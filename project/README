Raw database is too large to upload anywhere online, so we share a filtered version containing network connections & tweets of each account. The raw graph without any disconnected node-removal is under:

/berat/database/graph/graph_filtering

whereas the filtered graph, alongside gephi files for an overview, are under: 

/berat/database/graph

==============================================

NLP features (doc2vec & word2vec) are under: 

/berat/database/features

Actual models that extract these features aren't shared since they are very large.

==============================================

Neighbour embedding and relevant code, as well as features extracted for classification (binary encoding string) are located in:

/berat/neighbour_embedding

Text file 'results' in this directory shows the performance of best models working on neighbour embedding.

==============================================

Under:

/berat/nlp

You will find the relevant code for NLP section. The features extracted under:

/berat/database/features

are used here.

==============================================

You'll find every submission we did this semester (proposal, presentation, etc.) as well as the final report under root. The final report file is named 'final_report-berat_bicer-vahid_namakshenas.pdf'. If you wish the LaTeX source for this, let us know.

==============================================

Under:

/vahid

You'll find the material Vahid prepared alongside relevant results.
